# TagD Clean Architecture
The objective is demonstrating how to develop a technology agnostic native mobile application
by applying domain driven and clean architecture design practices.
    - It comes up with defining traits, basic building blocks at
[tagd-core](https://github.com/pavan2you/kmm-clean-architecture/tree/master/architecture/kmm-tagd-core/TAGD_CORE.md).
    - A clean architecture compatible multi layer, multi modular(scoped) tiny dependency injector at
[tagd-di](https://github.com/pavan2you/kmm-clean-architecture/tree/master/architecture/kmm-tagd-di/TAGD_DI.md).
    - A clean architecture stack with various patterns at
[tagd-arch](https://github.com/pavan2you/kmm-clean-architecture/tree/master/architecture/kmm-tagd-arch/TAGD_ARCH.md).
    - An android tagd concept impl + layer supers types + abstractions
[tagd-android](https://github.com/pavan2you/kmm-clean-architecture/tree/master/architecture/kmm-tagd-android/TAGD_ANDROID.md).
